        <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
        <p>
          As climate change continues to devastate the environment, many species have dwindled in numbers or gone extinct. 
          Birds across the world are especially affected, since they rely on migration to survive winters, but their migration habits are extremely sensitive to environmental factors. 
          <br>
          Habitat loss, changing day and night cycles, temperature shifts, rising sea levels, intense storms, all of these problems, caused or exacerbated by climate change, 
          can interfere with their migration. The reproductive success of birds often depends on their migratory success, as does their health, feeding behaviors, and stress [3][7].
          <br>
          With this project, I will be focusing on changes in the blackpoll warbler's migration patterns caused by climate change, as well as creating an interactive app
          that shows migration routes and information for 112 different bird species.

        <h2>Data!</h2>
        <p>
        	For statistics about bird populations, I used four different datasets: 
        CBC = Christmas Bird Count, 512 species, yearly North American bird abundance data
        BF = Migratory Birds Database, 112 species, migration locations with date & other data
        SMB = Status of Mountain Birds- 2024 review and 2010-2021 comprehensive dataset 
        For temperature data, I used timeseries temperature anomaly data from BerkeleyEarth.</p>
        <h2>Methodology!</h2>
        I picked the blackpoll warbler to do more detailed analysis on since it's classified as "Near Threatened" by IUCN, 
        undertakes long distance intercontinental migrations, and is "Moderately Vulnerable" to climate change warming effects, 
          according to the Audobon Institute. Using SMB data I modeled its population and whether its migration movements are changing with temperature.  
          I also graphed a few of its routes. I found that westward changes in longitude were happening as the years went by, 
          so I correlated these with the simulated temperature time series prediction data to make a Gillespie simulation to model the warbler’s possible routes. </p>
